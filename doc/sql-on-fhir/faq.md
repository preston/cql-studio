# SQL-on-FHIR FAQ

Practical Q&A for users and contributors driving the `/sql` workspace.

## Q: How do I run the demo?

1. `npm install && npm run start`
2. Open <http://localhost:4200/sql>
3. Click **Load CMS125 demo**
4. Step through the five panels via the left rail (FHIR Library → Decoded CQL → ELM Translation → Generated SQL → Execute SQL).
5. On the Execute step, click **Execute SQL**, then **Generate FHIR MeasureReport**.

The whole pipeline runs in your browser. PGlite (Postgres in WASM) is downloaded the first time you click Execute — ~3 MB.

## Q: Do I need a FHIR server?

**No.** Demo runs entirely in-browser.

If you *do* have a FHIR server (point CQL Studio's "FHIR Base URL" at it in Settings):

- **Save MeasureReport** button appears, POSTing the generated `MeasureReport` to `<server>/MeasureReport`.
- The standard "Server libraries" picker on `/sql` works too, letting you pick any Library resource with embedded CQL.

## Q: How does this compare to running CQL through the standard ELM interpreter?

| | SQL-on-FHIR (this PR) | Standard ELM interpreter |
|---|---|---|
| Authoring language | CQL | CQL |
| Intermediate representation | ELM JSON (from `@cqframework/cql`) | ELM JSON (from `@cqframework/cql`) |
| Execution | SQL against flat views | Per-patient iteration over FHIR resources |
| Runtime | PGlite (browser) or any Postgres / DuckDB / BigQuery | JVM (or `cql-execution` Node port) |
| Set-based | ✅ — one query plan over all patients | ❌ — patient-by-patient |
| Install | None (browser) or any SQL engine | JVM + jars, or Node + deps |
| Performance on 100k patients | Seconds | Minutes to hours |
| ELM coverage | Common eCQM subset (see [roadmap.md](./roadmap.md)) | Full ELM |
| Production maturity | Experimental (Connectathon 2026) | Mature, decade of investment |

They are complementary — see [vision.md](./vision.md). Sites with tuned ELM interpreters keep using them. Sites that want SQL-on-FHIR as their execution layer can now use that too.

## Q: How does CQL Studio translate CQL → ELM?

CQL Studio loads `@cqframework/cql` in the browser and calls `CqlTranslator.fromText(cql, libraryManager)`. The translator runs entirely client-side; ELM is produced as both XML (for the existing ELM viewer) and JSON (for the SQL pipeline). See [src/app/services/translation.service.ts](../../src/app/services/translation.service.ts).

## Q: How does ELM → SQL work?

A walking dispatch in [transpiler/elm-to-sql.ts](../../src/app/components/sql-on-fhir/elm-to-sql/transpiler/elm-to-sql.ts) emits one CTE per `define`. CTE names are SQL-safe versions of the CQL define names. The final `SELECT` aggregates `COUNT(*)` over the population CTEs.

Example (CMS125, abbreviated):

```sql
WITH
Patient AS ( SELECT * FROM patient_view ),
Qualifying_Encounters AS (
  SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM encounter_view
    WHERE type_code IN (SELECT code FROM value_set_expansion WHERE value_set_id = 'urn:oid:...Office Visit')) E
    WHERE tstzrange(E.period_start, E.period_end, '[)') <@ tstzrange('2024-01-01', '2024-12-31', '[)')
),
Initial_Population AS (
  SELECT Patient.* FROM Patient WHERE (
    Patient.gender = 'female'
    AND DATE_PART('year', AGE(lower(tstzrange('2024-01-01', '2024-12-31', '[)'))::date, Patient.birthdate)) >= 51
    AND DATE_PART('year', AGE(lower(tstzrange('2024-01-01', '2024-12-31', '[)'))::date, Patient.birthdate)) <= 74
    AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Qualifying_Encounters)
  )
),
-- ... Denominator, Denominator_Exclusion, Numerator
SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Initial_Population) AS Initial_Population_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Denominator) AS Denominator_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Denominator_Exclusion) AS Denominator_Exclusion_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Numerator) AS Numerator_count;
```

## Q: How is the demo data shaped?

[public/fhir/sql-on-fhir/cms125-bundle.json](../../public/fhir/sql-on-fhir/cms125-bundle.json) is a five-patient FHIR Bundle designed to produce specific population assignments:

| Patient | Gender | Age (2024) | Office visit | Mammography | Bilateral mastectomy | Expected populations |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Jane Doe | F | 60 | ✓ | ✓ (2024) | — | IP, Denom, Numer |
| Mary Smith | F | 56 | ✓ | — | — | IP, Denom |
| Linda Garcia | F | 64 | ✓ | — | ✓ | IP, Denom, **Denom Exclusion** |
| Bob Johnson | M | 62 | ✓ | — | — | — (male) |
| Amy Patel | F | 30 | ✓ | — | — | — (too young) |

Expected MeasureReport from the bundled data:

```
Initial Population      3
Denominator             3
Denominator Exclusion   1
Numerator               1
Measure Score           0.5   (= 1 / (3 - 1))
```

## Q: How do I add a new demo measure?

1. Drop the CQL source file in `public/fhir/sql-on-fhir/<name>.cql`.
2. Wrap it in a FHIR Library resource: `cms<id>-library.json` with `content[0].data` set to the base64-encoded CQL.
3. Add a small patient bundle: `<name>-bundle.json`. Five patients is enough to exercise populations.
4. Pre-expand any value sets you reference: `valuesets/<name>.json`. Even 3–5 codes per value set is fine for demos.
5. Add a method to [sql-on-fhir-demo.service.ts](../../src/app/services/sql-on-fhir/sql-on-fhir-demo.service.ts) that fetches them in parallel.
6. Add a button to [sql-on-fhir.component.html](../../src/app/components/sql-on-fhir/sql-on-fhir.component.html).

You do not need to write a Vitest spec for the new demo unless you want regression coverage on its specific population counts — the pipeline-level tests cover the moving parts.

## Q: What ELM operators does the transpiler support today?

See [src/app/components/sql-on-fhir/elm-to-sql/FAQ.md](../../src/app/components/sql-on-fhir/elm-to-sql/FAQ.md) for the canonical list. Highlights:

- **Tabular**: `Retrieve`, `Query` with `with`/`without` semi-joins, `Union`, `Intersect`, `Except`, `Distinct`.
- **References**: `ExpressionRef` (→ CTE reference), `FunctionRef` (limited set), `ParameterRef`, `ValueSetRef`.
- **Comparisons**: `Equal`, `NotEqual`, `Less`, `Greater`, `LessOrEqual`, `GreaterOrEqual`.
- **Boolean**: `And`, `Or`, `Xor`, `Not`, `IsNull`, `IsTrue`, `IsFalse`.
- **Type guards**: `Is`, `As` (collapses for FHIR choice elements like `Observation.effective`).
- **Intervals**: `In`, `IncludedIn`, `During` (with point or interval LHS), `Interval`, `Start`, `End`, `Contains`.
- **Aggregation**: `Exists`, `Count`, `Sum`, `Min`, `Max`, `Avg`, `AnyTrue`, `AllTrue`.
- **Dates**: `Today`, `Now`, `Date`, `DateTime`, `DurationBetween`, `AgeInYearsAt`, `AgeInMonthsAt`, `AgeInDaysAt`, `CalculateAgeAt`, `CalculateAgeInYearsAt`.
- **Coercion**: `ToDate`, `ToDateTime`, `ToInterval`, `ToString`, `ToInteger`, `ToDecimal`, `Coalesce`.
- **Conditionals**: `If`, `Case`.

If you hit an unsupported operator, the transpiler emits `NULL /* unsupported: <Operator> */` and surfaces a warning in the result. The SQL stays valid — that branch evaluates to NULL (i.e. false in a boolean context).

## Q: What if the SQL execution fails?

Common errors:

- `column ... does not exist` — the transpiler emitted a column name that doesn't exist in the flat schema. File an issue with the SQL output and the source CQL; usually a missing entry in `normalizePath`.
- `operator does not exist: ...` — a type mismatch between the LHS and RHS of a comparison. Check whether you're comparing an interval to a point or vice versa.
- `syntax error at or near "..."` — a transpiler bug. The Generated SQL panel shows the full emitted SQL; share that.

## Q: Can I run this against my own FHIR server?

Yes — point CQL Studio's **FHIR Base URL** in Settings at your server. The Library picker on `/sql` populates from `GET /fhir/Library` against that URL. Any Library resource with embedded CQL works.

Note that the SQL execution step still runs in your browser via PGlite — it operates on the **demo bundle's** patient data, not your live FHIR server. Once Preston's Issue #20 ships, a server-side execution path will become an option.

## Q: How do I run the HAPI FHIR JPA views?

See [scripts/hapi-fhir-sql-on-fhir/README.md](../../scripts/hapi-fhir-sql-on-fhir/README.md). Short version:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f scripts/hapi-fhir-sql-on-fhir/install.sql
```

`DATABASE_URL` points at the Postgres database backing your HAPI FHIR JPA server. The script is idempotent (`CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW`) and transactional.

Once views exist, the same SQL the in-browser demo emits can run against the HAPI database — that's the bridge to production. Preston's Issue #20 is the missing piece on the server-side wiring.

## Q: I want to contribute. Where do I start?

Read [vision.md](./vision.md) for the why, [roadmap.md](./roadmap.md) for what's next, and [architecture.md](./architecture.md) for the code map. Good starter issues:

- Add a CMS130 demo button (fixtures already shipped under `elm-to-sql/fixtures/`).
- Add DuckDB dialect support behind a `TranspilerOptions.dialect` flag.
- Extend `normalizePath` for FHIR properties not yet covered.
- Write a Playwright spec for the happy-path demo (see existing specs in `tests/`).

Pull requests against `feature/sql-on-fhir` are welcome until the branch merges, then against `master`.
