# OpenCode Integration

## Current boundary

The Angular UI contains the OpenCode IDE experience. The monorepo `server/` package owns the authenticated gateway and delegates isolated execution to the private `@cql-studio/opencode` service. In local development, both services run as separate host processes; Docker Compose provides backing infrastructure only.

The frontend always uses same-origin CQL Studio Server routes under `/api/opencode`. Provider URLs and credentials are request data for CQL Studio Server; the browser never connects OpenCode directly to a provider.

## Storage and filesystem model

The product currently has four distinct forms of storage:

| Area | Lifetime | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CQL IDE | Browser tab, backed by FHIR when saved | Open `Library` resources and unsaved CQL editor state |
| CQL Studio Workspace | Persistent server database | Access grants, shared environments, activity, and FHIR resource references |
| OpenCode session record | Persistent server database, owned by the SSO user | Conversation/state snapshot, session metadata, diffs, validation, and CQL Studio Workspace origin |
| OpenCode runner workspace | One live AI session | Writable active CQL file, read-only dependencies, and converted attachments |

An OpenCode session receives a snapshot. It does not receive browser storage or arbitrary host filesystem access. The active CQL file is writable; dependency snapshots and MCP integrations are read-only. Changes return as diffs and must pass the UI translation/save workflow before they are persisted to FHIR.

The active IDE **Problems** panel is sent as bounded, structured prompt context for the synchronized editor revision. OpenCode uses those exact diagnostics as its initial repair targets and then runs `cql_validate` against the changed workspace file. Lightweight conversation such as a greeting does not receive Problems context or CQL tools. Stale diagnostics are rejected if the browser revision no longer matches the runner workspace.

Every session includes the bundled FHIR R4 `FHIRHelpers` 4.0.1 source at `dependencies/FHIRHelpers.cql`, even when the active Library has not included it yet. The dependency is read-only. Repair instructions require OpenCode to inspect that file before choosing helper functions and to preserve the Library's existing alias (or add the matching include when necessary).

Attachments remain in the OpenCode session workspace until the session ends. Text files are stored as context directly. Formats such as PDF and DOCX are converted to Markdown when the optional MarkItDown executable is available on the host. Its absence does not prevent ordinary CQL chat or MCP use; a PDF/DOCX upload instead returns actionable installation guidance. `/compact` may retain summarized context while allowing the runner to purge original attachment files.

The gateway snapshots live session state to PostgreSQL and lists only records owned by the authenticated user. The Workspace **Sessions** tab shows that user's OpenCode conversations associated with the selected Workspace in a read-only view. A live runner session can continue accepting prompts. After a server/runner restart or idle cleanup, its saved state remains available as a read-only archived session.

From the IDE, `/resume` lists archived sessions associated with the active CQL Library. Resuming retains the same logical session and visible conversation, but creates a fresh isolated runner filesystem from the Library's current CQL and dependencies. A bounded text-only version of the saved conversation is restored as model context. Current provider settings and in-memory credentials are used; stale files, attachments, tool outputs, capabilities, and credentials are not restored.

The IDE's **End** action archives rather than deletes: it takes a final state snapshot, removes the ephemeral runner workspace and attachment files, and retains the user-owned conversation in PostgreSQL. Permanent deletion is a separate server operation and is not exposed by the read-only Workspace Sessions view.

## Workspace and environment context

Opening a Library from a CQL Studio Workspace preserves this frontend origin context on the IDE library tab:

- Workspace ID and name
- Workspace resource-reference ID
- Effective Workspace role

The origin is sent when a session is created and retained on the server-owned session. SSO and the application database are required. The gateway resolves the authenticated user's effective Workspace role and verifies that the resource reference identifies the active Library before starting the runner session.

Every OpenCode session is also bound to the active personal or shared Workspace environment at creation time. The binding contains environment identity and a fingerprint derived only from non-secret endpoint identity. If the active environment changes, the UI blocks prompts, uploads, tool answers, live edits, and saves for the old session. Ending and recreating the session is required.

## Multi-file CQL workspaces

Start with at least one writable CQL Library. The initially selected Library is the main file; all loaded writable library tabs join the same OpenCode workspace. Opening a file later adds it without resetting existing drafts. Closing a tab retains membership; deleting a Library removes it. The manifest maps paths to stable Library IDs, including after renames, and archived session state retains member snapshots.

Live edits identify the file being worked on and select its editor, reopening closed member tabs when necessary. Conflict detection compares the edited file's user revision. With live edits off, each changed file has independent save and discard actions. Saving validates the selected file and persists that Library ID, regardless of subsequent tab selection. Pending proposals remain available when another prompt refines them.

The MCP tools `cql_workspace_create` and `cql_workspace_rename` handle structural changes. Native edit tools can only change existing managed files. Each structural request pauses generation and presents the proposed CQL. Creation is automatically accepted with live edits enabled; renames always need explicit approval. The IDE saves a FHIR Library before acknowledging the operation to the runner. Failed saves remain pending for retry or rejection. New files are saved as CQL drafts; ELM is generated by the normal validated save flow. Renames discard stale ELM and retain the FHIR resource ID and canonical URL.

Run `npm run test:api --workspace=@cql-studio/opencode` for a deterministic integration test using the installed OpenCode binary, a local provider, and the real MCP transport. It requires localhost listeners and stops its temporary OpenCode process afterward.

## Credential handling

Provider API keys are held only in Angular memory:

- They are not written to `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`.
- They are not included in settings exports.
- Legacy persisted keys are absorbed into memory once and removed from stored settings.
- Reloading the page clears them.

The browser sends a key to CQL Studio Server only when listing provider models, creating a session, or resuming an archived session. The gateway retains session tool context in memory and sends the runner only an opaque, random MCP capability.

Environment bindings stored in `sessionStorage` do not include endpoint usernames, passwords, authorization values, URL credentials, query strings, or fragments.

## Frontend gateway contract

`OpenCodeService` currently consumes these CQL Studio Server routes:

| Method | Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/opencode/health` | Gateway and runner availability |
| `POST` | `/api/opencode/providers/models` | Provider model discovery |
| `GET/POST/DELETE` | `/api/opencode/sessions` | List, create, or permanently delete all owned sessions |
| `GET` | `/api/opencode/sessions?workspaceId=:id` | List the authenticated user's sessions for an accessible Workspace |
| `GET` | `/api/opencode/sessions/:id/state` | Read the current or persisted session state |
| `POST` | `/api/opencode/sessions/:id/resume` | Recreate an owned archived session using the active Library snapshot and current credentials |
| `POST` | `/api/opencode/sessions/:id/archive` | End the live runner workspace while retaining resumable conversation history |
| `DELETE` | `/api/opencode/sessions/:id` | Permanently delete an owned session (reserved for explicit history management) |
| `GET` | `/api/opencode/sessions/:id/events` | Ordered server-sent event stream |
| `POST` | `/api/opencode/sessions/:id/prompt` | Submit a prompt and editor context |
| `POST/DELETE` | `/api/opencode/sessions/:id/attachments` | Manage session documents |
| `PUT` | `/api/opencode/sessions/:id/active-file` | Synchronize content/revision by `libraryId` (main file when omitted) |
| `POST` | `/api/opencode/sessions/:id/libraries` | Add open library snapshots without overwriting existing drafts |
| `DELETE` | `/api/opencode/sessions/:id/libraries/:libraryId` | Remove a deleted Library from membership |
| `GET` | `/api/opencode/sessions/:id/diff` | Read pending filesystem changes |
| `GET/POST` | `/api/opencode/sessions/:id/commands` | Discover and execute slash commands |
| `GET` | `/api/opencode/sessions/:id/files` | Complete `@` file references |
| `POST` | `/api/opencode/sessions/:id/validate` | Validate all writable files, or a selected `file` |
| `POST` | `/api/opencode/sessions/:id/model` | Switch provider/model |
| `POST` | `/api/opencode/sessions/:id/abort` | Stop active generation |
| `POST/DELETE` | `/api/opencode/sessions/:id/permissions` and `/questions` | Resolve interactive OpenCode requests |

Wire-level request and response types live in `@cql-studio/core`. UI-only timeline, editor callback, and environment-binding state remains in `ui/src/app/models/opencode.model.ts`.

## VSAC validation and terminology import

The project-local `validate-vsac` OpenCode skill and `/validate-vsac` command audit an exact canonical URL/OID, or all VSAC ValueSet declarations in the active CQL file. The skill uses only read-only MCP tools: authoritative VSAC validation/discovery plus bounded reads and expansion checks against the configured terminology endpoint. It never writes a FHIR resource.

FHIR writes remain a deliberate CQL Studio action. Library save does not import VSAC ValueSets. From the CQL editor hover/right-click panel on a VSAC ValueSet declaration (or use), choose **Import from VSAC** for that ValueSet or **Import all from VSAC** for every VSAC ValueSet declared in the file. AI **Apply & save** still imports VSAC ValueSets referenced in the applied CQL when needed (labeled **Apply, import terminology & save**), using the same import service: search the configured terminology endpoint by exact canonical URL (preferring an expandable copy when duplicates exist), fetch missing or unusable resources through the authenticated VSAC proxy, and post them to the writable terminology endpoint (at most 50 ValueSets that are not already present/expandable per import). Merely mentioning a VSAC URL in chat never imports it.

## Remaining production checklist

1. Add an explicit production allowlist for OpenAI-compatible and private-network provider origins.
2. Publish multi-architecture runner images alongside the server image.
3. Run authenticated live FHIR and VSAC probes in deployment CI.
4. Resolve the current production audit advisories in the Prisma/config dependency chain with compatible server upgrades, then rerun the root production audit.
